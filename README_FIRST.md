# Project Setup Instructions

## Maildev Configuration:

1. Install Maildev using: `npm install maildev`
2. Start Maildev with: `maildev`
3. Access the Maildev interface in your browser at: (http://0.0.0.0:1080/)


Make sure to do these steps before testing the project, as I've used Maildev to send emails for verifying users. This helps in confirming user identities and activating users after they register.
